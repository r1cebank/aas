## Overview

YAAS is a complete ready-to-use asset server that support file versioning as well as data manipulation

##### Example `http://localhost:3939/rai/261671.jpeg?scale=0.5&crop=[200,200]`
(this will get the jpeg named `261671` and apply 0.5 scale and crop 200x200 pixels from the center)

**There are no external runtime dependencies**, you don't need to install anything extra to use this.

**This module is actively developed by Siyuan Gao.**

### Installation

0.	Download the package in .zip
1. `npm install`
2. `npm install -g gulp`
2. You can run the tests with `npm test`

### Build and run
0.	Run	 `gulp`
1. Run `node ./build`

### Configuration

YAAS is very configurable, but minminal configuration is needed to run on your system.

#### Configure Authority
The server authority is what uses to authorize every request came from the client.

In `./src/config/config.js` (line 21)

		auth: {
        type: 'local',
        keys: {
            c9cba3d805ff526866d27b5504005766: {
                roles: [
                    'yaas:list',
                    'bucket:create',
                    'bucket:upload',
                    'bucket:list',
                    'file:get',
                    'version:list'
                ]
            }
        },
        overwrites: {
            'file:get': 'none',
            'version:list': 'none'
        }
    }
    
`auth` is an object, it has two properties, `type` and anything else.
`type` is requires indicating what type of authentication will be using
	
* none (anything is ok)
* local (api key and role based authentication)
* overwrites is for the roles you want to apply a different authentication method (example: `'file:get': 'none'` means even we defined local authentical for every action, we will skip authentication for `file:get`

More information is [here](#authentication)

#### Configure Host
In order to get some features to work properly, (not required for basic feature) we need to configure the hostname correctly in `./src/config/config.js`
	
	host:       'http://localhost:3939'
Here put the hostname of the server/computer you are running YAAS on, if you don't know what to put, leave it default.

**Note:** If you are using a custom port other than `3939`, please change the port name in `host` as well.

		ie. host:       'http://localhost:80'

#### Configure port

		1.	index.js (line 24)
		2. ./src/config/config.js
To specify which port your asset server will be running on, use `process.env.PORT` or specify port in `config.js`

#### Upload file save path

		1.	index.js (line 41)
		2.	./src/config/config.js
You can change the upload file saving path by changing the storage object in line 41 or change it in config.js

**Note:** currently it doesn't support absolute file path, please stick to config.js and use relative path.

#### Upload file save name

		1.	index.js (line 45)
Changing the `filename` function to modify the behavior or the naming process of `multer` module, currently all uploaded files will be named 

		[a 7-14 character unique id].[file extension]
		example: EJuZ0D72.jpeg

### Usage
#### Create a new bucket

**POST** `http://localhost:3939/bucket`

**Params** `auth: [credential], name: [name of the bucket]`

**Errors**

	{
  		"error": "bucket [name] exists"
	}
**Response**

	{
	  "message": "bucket rai2 created",
	  "url": "http://localhost:3939/rai"
	}
	
**url** if host is configured correctly, this will be the url for accessing your bucket

#### Create a new upload
**POST** `http://localhost:3939/[bucket]/upload`

**Params** `auth: [credential], file: [files to be uploaded]`

**Errors**

	{
  		"error": "file not supplied"
	}
	{
  		"error": "bucket [name] not found"
	}
	{
		"error": "bucket key is incorrect"
	}
**Output**
	
	{
	  "fieldname": "file",
	  "originalname": "261671.jpeg",
	  "encoding": "7bit",
	  "mimetype": "image/jpeg",
	  "destination": "./storage/",
	  "filename": "EJuZ0D72.jpeg",
	  "path": "storage/EJuZ0D72.jpeg",
	  "size": 205643,
	  "versions": {
	    "NygObRwXh": "storage/EJuZ0D72.jpeg"
	  },
	  "latestversion": "NygObRwXh",
	  "url": "http://localhost:3939/rai/261671.jpeg"
	}
This is all the information stored on local [nedb](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb), including all the versions and the latest version, with the url to access the file.

#### Get the file

**GET** `http://localhost:3939/[bucket]/filename`

**Params** `auth: [credential]`

**Errors**

	{
  		"error": "file VkWspSXh.jpeg not found."
	}
**Response**

	The file requested

#### To get a specific version of a file

**GET** `http://localhost:3939/[bucket]/[file]?v=[version]`

**Params** `auth: [credential]`

**Errors**

	{
  		"error": "version NygObRwXh1 not found"
	}
**Response**

	The file requested

#### List all the buckets

**GET** `http://localhost:3939/list`

**Params** `auth: [credential]`

**Errors**

	none
	
**Response**

	[
	  "rai2",
	  "rai"
	]
Its a JSON array including all the buckets in the system

#### List all files in buckets

**GET** `http://localhost:3939/[bucket]/list`

**Params** `auth: [credential]`

**Errors**

	{
	  "error": "bucket ra1i not found"
	}
	
**Response**

	[
	  "http://localhost:3939/rai/261671.jpeg"
	]
Its a JSON array including all the files in bucket

#### List all versions for a file

**GET** `http://localhost:3939/[bucket]/[file]/list`

**Params** `auth: [credential]`

**Errors**

	{
	  "error": "file 2616721.jpeg not found."
	}
	{
	  "error": "bucket r1ai not found"
	}
	
**Response**

	[
	  "http://localhost:3939/rai/261671.jpeg?v=NygObRwXh"
	]
Its a JSON array including all version urls for a file, if only one file exist, you can access it just by url (without the v)

### Authentication

#### None
For this authenticatin type, server will ignore anything in the auth field which means you don't have to provide any credentials.

**Note:** not recommended, should be used as overwrite to make some calls public

#### Local
For this authentication type, api keys will be defined in `config.js` like this:

	auth: {
        type: 'local',
        keys: {
            c9cba3d805ff526866d27b5504005766: {
                roles: [
                    'yaas:list',
                    'bucket:create',
                    'bucket:upload',
                    'bucket:list',
                    'file:get',
                    'version:list'
                ]
            }
        },
        overwrites: {
            'file:get': 'none',
            'version:list': 'none'
        }
    }
**First** `type` tells the server we are using `local` as authentication method, so during server's bootstrap, the correct authenticator will be loaded.

**Second**, `keys` tells server what keys are allowed to access this api, the `role` is an array contains all the roles the key is authrorized.

**Last** (optional), `overwrites` is very important if you want to customize authentications type for each role. The example here `'file:get' : 'none'` means even the global authentication method is `local`, we will skil authentication for `'file:get': 'none'` 


### Supported actions

* image/jpeg
	* scale
	* crop (from center or specify x,y)
	* rotate (degrees, fill color is white)
	* blur (glaussan blur)
	* sharken (sharpen the image)
	* mirror (flip the image around an axis)
	* saturate (adjust saturation)
	* lighten (increase brightness)
	* darken (decrease brightness)
	* hue (adjust hue)
* application/json
	* search

### Supported files

* image/jpeg

## Customization

##### File transformation
This is a tough part, to modify the transformation for a specific file, first I need to talk about the transformation files stored in project structure

```
-transform (the root folder for all transformation)
|--image	(the root folder for mimetype image)
  |--jpeg	(the root folder containing image/jpeg transformation
    |--transform.js (the actual file for image/jpeg transformation
```
You might have seen, the transformation files are stored according to their mimetype. For example, the `text/javascript` mimetype will be stored under `./src/transform/text/javascript/transform.js`

**Note:** For any transformation you define, make sure it returns a **Promise** and resolve the transformed file path.

## Who am I?

I am Siyuan Gao, a Mobile application developer, full-stack developer, designer from Vancouver, BC. I creates projects all the time for fun, or just because I want to bring a tool to life. To contact me, please email me at: `siyuangao at gmail d0t c0m`

## Todo list

0. Make the project more stuctured, (no more big source files)
1. Make adding transformation easier
2. Allow user to config authentication [*](#authentication)
3. HTTPS support
4. Better manage disk space
5. More Mocha tests (**sorry, need to write more tests)
